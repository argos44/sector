#Open a figure window. In Matlab, the difficulty is graphics output of dead simple math*/ #Figure windows have handlers, which are bsically process IDs, of some sort*/ #You can reference them with this handler, or pid*/
#But, the relevance of output methods in a simple archiecture is more of a logical thought, rarely used in such simple syntax environment, because logical expectations combine well with something else....*/

#The idea that you can easily implement in GNU Octave, or its origin, the Matlab , is to introduce a random time wait, or pause between slightly altered sine wave function plottings, recalculated twice , once for each function, at every iteration*/

#Normally, the nowhere variance of induced states are prognozing an offshoot from redundant random generation methods*/

  #parallel is a name of a variable hat I just gave, and the data for the xor.pseudo seed is returned into a single integer or double, as a 1x1 matrix, or slab.... :)*/

#Have to close the figure window to continue with the iteraion. But the overall speed of drawing a new window, AND plot the function, which should be exactly the same without the random pause.*/

#The functions are the same, except they originate from different x axis values, or truncated coordinates. Truncated means that only one element of a pair of numbers defining a point in vectorspace are available.

That is the value of the origin point of the sine function on the x axis
#So, graphically you can intercept visual patterns emerging from the constant speed of the graphics card, the cpu, the memory bus speed, and this combined with a random pause between iterations, or instantiation of a new graphics windows #The random generation of the waiting time is also consuming CPU time
