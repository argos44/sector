%so..... try out matlab 5 for android... i am notsure, but I think it is ok for mathworks, since it is from around millennia.

%also, the cities... yes, because your hand is below eye4 leve... so... anatomically.... be happy at home with your android :DD

#Open a figure window. In Matlab, the difficulty is graphics output of dead simple math*/ 
#Figure windows have handlers, which are bsically process IDs, of some sort*/ 
#You can reference them with this handler, or pid (ProcessId)*/
#But, the relevance of output methods in a simple archiecture is more of a logical thought, rarely used in such simple syntax environment, because logical expectations combine well with something else....*/

#The idea that you can easily implement in GNU Octave, or its origin, the Matlab , is to introduce a random time wait, or pause between a 1/x value plotted as  sine function input - sine wave function plottings are relatively easy in Octave - there is a figure window declaration (without a handler, because handlers become useful when there are multiple windows existing in memory simultaneoulsy. The for loop loops through the loop every time, is called an iteration.

#Normally, the nowhere variance of induced states are prognozing an offshoot from redundant random generation methods*/


for i = 3:24 

  figure(1);
  
  fplot (@sin, [1/-10, 1/10], 2661);

    #parallel = empirical_rnd (1);*/

    #parallel is a name of a variable that I just gave, and the data for the xor.pseudo seed is returned into a single integer or double, as       a 1x1 matrix, or Jslab.... :)*/
  
    #parallel is actually never used in this code, or snippet (a small code, or a part of  larger code), but that is ok, because it is             declared in the RAM, or memory of the PC (personal computer), :DDD but you already know that.

#The overall speed of drawing a new window, AND plot the function, should be exactly the same every time. If iz is not, watch lunar landing Neil Armstrong using the word glitch, when the camera cross gets obscured*/

#The functions are the same, except they originate from different x axis values, or truncated coordinates. Truncated means that only one element of a pair of numbers defining a point in vectorspace are available.

That is the value of the origin point of the sine function on the x axis
#So, graphically you can intercept visual patterns emerging from the constant speed of the graphics card, the cpu, the memory bus speed, and this combined with a random pause between iterations, or instantiation of a new graphics windows 

#The random generation of the waiting time is also consuming CPU time, so it is inherently (axiomatically, by default) recursive. That you probably don't know what it is, so look up Julia fractals.

#Note, that line 63 (that is the value) is without the comment hashtag. So, if you would put more code after that, it won't run.

#Also, I edited this online now (the comments), so I cnnot be sure if it runs okay now, because I have changed it.
